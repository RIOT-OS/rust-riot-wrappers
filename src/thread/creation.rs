/// Lifetimed helper through which threads can be spawned.
///
/// ## Lifetimes
///
/// The involved lifetimes ensure that all parts used to build the thread (its closure, stack, and
/// name) outlive the whole process, which (given the generally dynamic lifetime of threads) can
/// only be checked dynamically.
///
/// The lifetimes are:
///
/// * `'env`: A time surrounding the [`scope()`] call. All inputs to the thread are checked to live
///   at least that long (possibly longer; it is commonplace for them to be `'static`).
/// * `'id`: An identifying lifetime (or brand) of the scope. Its lifetime is somewhere inbetween
///   the outer `'env` and the run time of the called closure.
///
///   Practically, don't think of this as a lifetime, but more as a disambiguator: It makes the
///   monomorphized CountingThreadScope unique in the sense that no two instances of
///   CountingThreadScope can ever have the same type.
///
///   By having unique types, it is ensured that a counted thread is only counted down (in
///   [`.reap()`]) in the scope it was born in, and that no shenanigans with counters being swapped
///   around with [core::mem::swap()] are used to trick the compiler into allowing use-after-free.
///
/// This technique was inspired by (and is explained well) in [the GhostCell
/// Paper](http://plv.mpi-sws.org/rustbelt/ghostcell/paper.pdf).

//! A rewrite of the SPI wrappers that uses the [`embedded-hal` 1.0 model](embedded_hal::spi) of
//! SPI.
//!
//! This is a dedicated module because the abstractions of that version differ significantly from
//! what was in 0.2 that inspired the original implementation. With the next breaking release of
//! `riot-wrappers`, this module will replace the [`super`] module (possibly with a compatibility
//! alias).
//!
//! # HAL author notes
//!
//! The `embedded-hal` documentations has some [notes for HAL
//! authors](https://docs.rs/embedded-hal/latest/embedded_hal/spi/index.html#for-hal-authors); not
//! all those are followed here:
//!
//! * "HALS **must not** add infrastructure for sharing at the `SpiBus` level": RIOT already has
//!   that infrastructure; users don't have a guarantee on exclusive, but that's not even SPI
//!   specific: For all it's worth, the SPI hardware can be multiplexed into (say) I2C hardware,
//!   or anything else (hey maybe it's bit banging and the bitbanging core is just busy). At any
//!   rate, this crate is not going out of its way to do that, it's a consequence of being in the
//!   operating system, and technically it's not worse than being preempted by some interrupt.

// In RIOT, there is no type-level distinction between a bus and a device -- if it's acquired with

// the SpiDevice pattern. (The distinction of whether something is owned exclusively or not can not
// be made in RIOT as it has no concept of exclusive device ownership.)

// into the transaction function, which is largely modeled after the HAL SpiDevice's API (taking an
// Operations list like SpiDeivce::transaction()).

// This may or may not be efficient depending on what the compiler inlines, but really, if you want
// efficient, go with SpiDevice anyway for hardware CS. Another downside of this approach is that
// it means that ZTimer is a dependency even when not using SpiDevice; sticking with it for overall

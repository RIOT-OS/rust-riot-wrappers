//! Create, inspect or modify RIOT processes ("threads")
//!
//! ## Tokens
//!
//! Some thread creation mechanisms (currently only [riot_main_with_tokens] and not those in here)
//! are "with tokens". With these, the zero-sized type [StartToken] is used to pass along the
//! information that the execution is currently happening in a thread, and more importantly that
//! some operations doable only once per thread (eg. setting up a message queue) have not yet
//! happed.
//!
//! When threads are created that way, they need to return a [TerminationToken] which ensures that
//! no operations that preclude the termination of a thread have happened.
//!
//! This has multiple implementations:
//! - one wrapping the RIOT (C) core/ API
//!
//! The right implementation is selected with help from the build system, similar to how std's
//! platform dependent backends are selected.

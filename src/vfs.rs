//! Access to the [Virtual File System (VFS) layer](http://doc.riot-os.org/group__sys__vfs.html)
//!
//! This abstraction tries not to be smart about modes -- a [File] opened with RDONLY will still
//! have a write method, and because file operations are generally fallible, writes will just fail.
//!
//! ## Panics
//!
//! This module violently asserts that file names are UTF-8 encoded (a condition easily satisfied
//! if only ASCII file names are used).
//!
//! ## Incomplete
//!
//! So far, only a subset of VFS is implemented; in particular, the file system is read-only.

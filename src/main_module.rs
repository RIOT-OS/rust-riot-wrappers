//! Tools for providing a RIOT main function
//!
//! The main contribution of this module is the [`riot_main!`](super::riot_main!) macro.
//!
//! The alternative to using that (other than doing it manually) is to have C code along with the
//! Rust application that occupies the main function.
//!
//! In these cases, Rust code can be called into from the main C code by declaring the entry
//! functions `#[no_mangle] pub extern "C"`, and having analogous `extern` functions in the calling
//! C code.

use crate::stdio::println;
use crate::thread::{EndToken, StartToken};

// General alternative to this module: Build the extern "C" main all the time and request that the
// application implement a named function. I never got the main function to be carried to the
// linker step, though. If implemented like this, the module needs to be gated like
// set_panic_handler.
//
// extern "Rust" {
//     fn riot_main();
// }
//
// #[no_mangle]
// pub extern "C" fn main() -> u32 {
//     unsafe { riot_main() };
//     0
// }

/// To have a nice Rust main function, run the `riot_main!` macro with the name of your main
/// function an item (ie. top level in a module) in your crate. The function identified by it must
/// return something that implements the Termination trait.
///
/// Example:
///
/// ```
/// # #![no_std]
/// # use riot_wrappers::riot_main;
/// riot_main!(main);
///
/// fn main() {
///     unimplemented!()
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Functions with multiple signatures are accepted:
///
/// * `fn main()` -- useful for very simple programs
/// * `fn main() -> impl Termination` -- prints the error message according to the [Termination]
///   implementation (in particular, [Result] types with a [Debug] error are useful here)
/// * `fn main(tokens: StartToken) -> (impl Termination, EndToken)` -- this ensures that
///   the program has full control over the main thread. As a [StartToken] allows doing things that
///   require undoing before the thread may terminate (eg. subscribing it to messages), an
///   [EndToken] needs to be produced before the thread can terminate with a message as
///   above.
/// * `fn main(tokens: StartToken) -> !` -- a frequently useful variation thereof for main loops
///   that are loops anyway.

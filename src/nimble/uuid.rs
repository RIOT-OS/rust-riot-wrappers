//! Type wrappers for BLE UUIDs

//! The [Uuid16], [Uuid32] and [Uuid128] types represent UUIDs of their given lengths, have
//! conversion functions to get suitable pointers for the initialization of larger structs and for
//! accessing the address in Bluetooth's serialization, and provide a convenient [FromStr]
//! implementation (ie. can be `.parse()`d) for conversion from string-formatted UUIDs.

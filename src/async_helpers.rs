//! Tools used internally to create futures more easily

use core::future::Future;

/// A trait similar to Future that is practical to implement for the typical RIOT situations where
/// a waker needs to be converted into a function and argument pointer.
///
/// Wrapped in a [RiotStylePollStruct], it implements [Future], and the conversion between the arg
/// pointer and the full struct is taken care of. That wrapper may also do any optimizations such
/// as not really storing the waker if it can be compressed to a single word instead.
///
/// ## Implementing
///
/// While this can legally be implemented without unsafe, practical use will require unsafe, and
/// that requires sticking to the rules:
///
/// * Whenever [Self::poll()] is called, do whatever the future needs to do after having been awoken. If
///   this returns [core::task::Poll::Pending] (and the future wants to be polled ever again), it
///   must then pass on the `arg` to some RIOT callback setter together with a static function of a
///   suitable signature. Conventionally, that function is called `Self::callback()`.
///
/// * When that callback function is called (and has any arguments), it may inspect the arguments
///   to decide to return early (for example, if it receives "chatter" that is unrelated to the
///   completion of the future). If it decides that this is now the callback that should make
///   progress, it must call [`RiotStylePollStruct::<Self>::callback(arg)`], with `arg` being the
///   value that was passed around through RIOT from the poll function.
///
/// * To the author's knowledge, the mechanism itself has no requirements of not shuffling any
///   items in and out of any `&mut` that are involved (otherwise, they would be pinned). However,
///   the callback mechanism itself may require no such shuffling to occur, in which case it is the
///   implementor's responsibility to not just move its data around.

// FIXME: I'm not sure the presence and absence of #[pin] is right about these ones, but anyway,
// given they're not pub, and this module is what captures the unsafety guarantees (assisted by the
// requirements on RiotStyleFuture), this should be no worse than manually safe-declaring any

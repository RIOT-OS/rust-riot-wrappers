//! Tools for running RIOT's built-in shell
//!
//! This module can be used in two ways:
//!
//! * Declare static commands using [`static_command!`](crate::static_command!); these only take a
//!   `fn` (not a closure) because shell commands don't have an arg pointer.
//!
//!   This works even in RIOT modules that are included in a C application that starts a shell, and
//!   show up in shells created through Rust without explicit inclusion.
//!
//! * Use [new] to start building a [CommandList]. This can have full closures as commands, but
//!   these are available only when the shell is then started through the CommandList's run
//!   methods.
//!
//! ## Note on complexity of this module
//!
//! Quite a bit of complexity in this module is due to building the array of commands, and
//! moreover, creating trampoline functions that go through a global mutex to get a hold of the
//! command list -- an exercise necessary due to the RIOT commands' lack of a `*void data`
//! argument. This does allow the Rust wrappers to "just so" use a closure as a command handler,
//! but also needs a lot of code.
//!
//! That complexity is not pulled in when only using [`static_command!`](crate::static_command!)
//! and running on an otherwise empty command list.

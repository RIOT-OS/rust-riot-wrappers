//! A safe-to-use interface for [RIOT messages](https://doc.riot-os.org/group__core__msg.html)
//!
//! This module's main contribution is [MessageSemantics], a chaining family of ZSTs that
//! represent which types a thread expects to come in on which message numbers. From that, pairs of
//! [SendPort]s (through which other threads send messages) and [ReceivePort]s (using which
//! received messages are decoded) are split off.
//!
//! For safety, the module relies on other components not tossing around messages indiscriminately.
//! In Rust, senders are told through the SendPort how the recipient will transmute the data back.
//! For C components, safe wrappers (TBD: will) require and consume appropriate tickets and from
//! there on rely on the C side to only send what is described in the API.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! A comprehensive example of how this is currently used is maintained in [the msg_tests
//! example](https://gitlab.com/etonomy/riot-examples/-/blob/master/msg_tests/src/lib.rs).
//!
//! ## Stability
//!
//! This module is still WIP and not subject to the semver-ish conduct upheld even in pre-1.0
//! versions of riot-wrappers. The module is hidden behind the `with_msg_v2` feature to make that
//! clear.
//!
//! ## Status vs. Road map
//!
//! Conceptually, this module is built for threads that can shut down again, or for receiving
//! messages only in defined times (eg. when ). All information is preserved to allow ports split
//! off from a thread's message number pool to be recombined, pending messages to be drained and
//! the thread set up to receive completely different messages on the same message type numbers.
//!
//! Practically, this is not implemented, because threads are not commonly used in a
//! run-and-shut-down pattern in RIOT. Some documentation refers to the process of recombination
//! already.
//!
//! It might still be tricky to actually perform that recombination safely, as there can be queued
//! up messages. One pattern that is anticipated to work here is to define a single channel on
//! which a SendPort can be returned through the message queue; thus, by the time it gets returned,
//! the receiver can be sure that nothing else is left in the queue.

/// just to create a version that can be cloned at will but never recombined any more. (One way to
/// do the latter would be to add a const boolean type parameter "CLONED"; a `.clonable(self) ->

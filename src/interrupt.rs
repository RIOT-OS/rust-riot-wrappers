//! Interaction with interrupts
//!
//! The RIOT wrappers offer two ways to interact with interrupts:
//!
//! * Utility functions can disable interrupts (creating critical sections), check whether
//!   interrupts are enabled or to determine whether code is executed in a thread or an ISR.
//!
//! * Some functions (eg. [`ZTimer::set_ticks_during`](crate::ztimer::Clock::set_during))
//!   take callbacks that will be called in an interrupt context.
//!
//!   These are typechecked to be Send, as they are moved from the thread to the interrupt context.
//!
//! Not provided by riot-wrappers are methods of implementing interrupts that are directly called
//! by the CPU's interrupt mechanism. These are `extern "C"` functions (often with a `() -> ()`
//! signature) exported under a particular name using `#[no_mangle]`. Any platform specifics (such
//! as the [`riot_sys::inline::cortexm_isr_end()`] function) need to be managed by the
//! implementer, just as when implementing a C interrupt.
//!
//! Rust code intended for use within interrupts does not generally need special precautions -- but
//! several functions (generally, anything that blocks) are discouraged (as they may fail or stall
//! the system) outside of a thread context, or even "forbidden" (because they reliably lock up the
//! system, such as [crate::mutex::Mutex::lock()]). These functions often have preferred
//! alternatives that can be statically known to be executed in a thread context by keeping a copy
//! of [`crate::thread::InThread`].

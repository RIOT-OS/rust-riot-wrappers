//! Tools for registering a Rust device in SAUL
//!
//! A SAUL sensor or actuator is expressed as an implementation of [Drivable]. Once built, that
//! drivable is registered at SAUL, either through [register_and_then], or through building a
//! [Registration] for a `'static` place and calling [Registration::register_static].
//!
//! As SAUL decouples the per-type parts of a sensor from the per-instance parts, there is a
//! [Driver] struct that manages the per-type aspects. This driver also manages the dynamic
//! dispatch by being generic over the [Drivable] and exposing untyped function pointers. (In a
//! sense, SAUL ships its own version of Rust's `dyn`, and Driver manages that).
